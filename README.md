# TravelScapes-frontend

Link - https://mernstack-project-14966.web.app/

This is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project that allows users to authenticate, add, edit, and delete places they've visited. The application provides functionality for viewing the location of each place through the Google Maps JavaScript API and utilizes the Geocoding API to convert addresses into coordinates. User and place data are stored in MongoDB Atlas, and passwords are securely hashed on the backend.

## Features

- User authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out of the application.
- Create, edit, and delete places: Users can add places they've visited, update their details, and remove places from their travel log.
- Google Maps integration: Each place includes a map showing the location using the Google Maps JavaScript API.
- Geocoding: The application utilizes the Geocoding API to convert addresses into coordinates for accurate map representation.
- Secure password storage: User passwords are securely hashed on the backend to ensure data protection.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A NoSQL document database used to store user and place data.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used to build the backend server.
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces used for the frontend development.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used to run server-side JavaScript code.
- Google Maps JavaScript API: Provides mapping functionality and integration with the application.
- Geocoding API: Converts addresses into geographical coordinates.
- bcrypt.js: A library used for password hashing.
- Bootstrap: A CSS framework used for styling the frontend components.
